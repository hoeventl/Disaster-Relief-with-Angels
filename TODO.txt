Begin introduction, find anything to motviate this idea. This is not another made up problem for just math people
Lit review: 
    "visual review" show superceding problem formulation. This describes how our problem is generalized.
    "dendrogram" (tougher) start from the latest developments in similar problems and work backwards and describe how those converge
        --follows the history of the problem
    Chrys to send examples of both
    "table" kinda do a direct comparison and explain how we are different/similar

Looks like solutions are going from angel -> shadow node -> angel -> shadow node
    At least in "one_per_cluster"
    May need to add a nonzero (some epsilon) on edge weight from angel to/from shadow

Struggling on dual side (Gurobi)

Items for me:
    - write abstract!! due for us Nov 15!! due Nov 17? 
    - literature review
    - find example of where community came to help (as we go, not urgent)

Draw radii, (use an empty node and specify size [scaling is weird])
