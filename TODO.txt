Begin introduction, find anything to motviate this idea. This is not another made up problem for just math people
Lit review: 
    "visual review" show superceding problem formulation. This describes how our problem is generalized.
    "dendrogram" (tougher) start from the latest developments in similar problems and work backwards and describe how those converge
        --follows the history of the problem
    Chrys to send examples of both

Items for me:
    - come up with experiments
    - begin introduction
    - code comments
