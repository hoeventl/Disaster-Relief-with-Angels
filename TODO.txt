- network write meta data text file
- network input checking
- plot give title/axes
- network smart update when field is manually changed (use setters)
- experiment allow for multiple runs of same (when randomization is included like connectivity)
    - this requires analysis during runtime, which is not currently supported. Currently, the 
    analysis occurs post experiment. This design choice was so that a dedicated server can run the 
    optimization problems as fast as possible and to save progress in case of failure.

CODE EXAMPLES (likely jupyter notebooks)
- show how to use a network and model object to interface with networkx
